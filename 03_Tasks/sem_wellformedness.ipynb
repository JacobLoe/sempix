    "What is it that makes the assertion odd that \"colourless green ideas sleep furiously\"? It is not a *syntactic* problem, goes the famous claim \\cite{chomsky:synstruc}, but rather a semantic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent book \\cite{asher_2011}, Nicholas Asher analyses the fact that certain expressions appear odd (e.g., \"Tigers are financial institutions\") as being due to the semantic ill-formedness of the *predications* they express, proposing that this is something that lexical semantics ought to explain. (In Asher's approach, this is done via fine-grained semantic types and type hierarchies, through which certain applications can be blocked.) (See also \\cite{Vecchi2017}.)\n",

    "## Creating Data \n",
    "It is relatively straightforward to create odd expressions by manipulating attested expressions found in a corpus. (For example, by taking a source sentence like \"Pierre Vinken will join the board as a nonexecutive director.\" and swapping in an NP taken from a distractor sentence, to yield for example \"Pierre Vinken will join the board as the striped zebra.\") A statistical language model, provided that it has enough capacity, could be expected to easily *detect* such manipulations (as the string as a whole presumably will be assigned a lower likelihood than the original version). It can however not contribute to an *explanation* of this oddness. (Which for the tiger example above would be something like \"tigers are concrete objects, financial institutions are abstract objects; nothing can be both a concrete and an abstract object\", and for the Vinken example would be something like \"being a striped zebras is not a function on an executive board\".) What is required here is a *conceptual* analysis that addresses the predication failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "While manipulated expressions can be constructed from any text corpus, using the corpora described here could potentially have some advantages. First, the expressions in these corpora are relatively simple (compared to newspaper text, for example), and so offer a simpler access to the phenomenon. Second, having the semantc annotation available (the segmented images) gives us more control over the distractor sentences and hence over the types of manipulation."

    "The semantic oddness, to the degree there is any for the samples, resides in the relation that is confronted with a non-attested pair of arguments.

More control would be possible, if desired.)\n",

What is it that makes this at least curious, more so than the source expression \"white clouds in blue sky\"? We know that clouds are a metereological phenomenon, and as such there is a very limited range of entities that they can be \"in\". To assign any meaning to the manipulated phrase, we must coerce \"white clouds\" into something like \"pictures of white clouds\"; even then, \"in\" isn't quite the right choice of preposition. \n",
