    "# Task: Predicting Entailments\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an overview of tasks that make use of images as implicit link between utterances. What follows from the fact that two expressions were provided for the same image (object)? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the perspective established above, where we see images as models of sentences, the question would be \"what follows from being true in the same model\"? In logics, the answer would be \"not much\", as there models are supposed to be stand-ins for the world as a whole (or rather, for one possible world among infinitely many), and many things can be true at the same time, without there being a logical connection between these facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "But our models are perhaps better described as *situations* with some internal coherence stemming from the fact that they are individual slices of the world. (Hence, *situation semantics* \\cite{barwiseperry:sitatt} might have been the more appropriate formalisation to use in the background, but it is a bit more involved than first-order logic, which I used here.) \n",
    "\n",
    "We can thus reformulate our question to: \"what follows from being true in the same situation?\", and investigate whether we can derive a notion of *situational entailment*. This we do in this notebook. The strategy will be to go through the various possible combinations of anchors (image objects) and expression types (referring expressions, captions, etc.) and to inspect the resulting expression pairs. We will also create \"negative\" examples of expressions that might have been taken from the same situation, but weren't. If there is any regularity to the phenomenon, a model of it should be able to distinguish between same-situation pairs and different-situation ones."

    "In the literature, the relation of interest here is typically called *entailment* or *implication*, which is a more general relation than the *logical* entailment studied in formal semantics. In the most general formulation, a sentence  (lets call it the *hypothesis*) is *implied* by another sentence (or set of sentences; let's call this the *premise*), if accepting the premise makes one (more likely to) accept the hypothesis as well \\cite{chierchi:meaning}. (This is also how later the influential \"recognising textual entailment\" challenge \\cite{Dagan:rte} introduced the relation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be called a pragmatic view on the relation, as it revolves around *accepting* a statement. In formal semantics, one abstracts away from this to yield a universally valid relation (independent of what anyone may or may not choose to accept). Interestingly, there are typically two ways in which the relation can then be explicated. Going the semantic route (and then typically calling the relation *semantic consequence* and using $\\models$ as relation symbol), the notion of truth  as introduced above is harnessed, and the definition becomes \"all models that make the premises true also make the hypothesis true\". Going the syntactic route (and then typically calling the relation *syntactic consequence* and using $\\vdash$ as symbol), the relation is assumed to hold if there is a sequence of applications of syntactic rules that transform the premises into the hypothesis. As the rules are seen as truth-preserving, the idea is that both paths, semantic and syntactic, actually describe the same relation (that is, cover the same pairs of premises and hypotheses). This is the case for some logics, but not all. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting task could be to try to set up both \"paths\" (via models / truth and via syntactic transformations) for the tasks described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we launch into the investigation of the data, a few words on related work. The influential \"recognising textual entailments\" challenge was already mentioned above. Under the name \"natural language inference\", the task has recently seen enormous renewed interest. Interestingly, the paper starting this revival, \\cite{snli:emnlp2015}, used image captions as starting point. However, instead of making use of the linked image, they only used the caption as trigger, and asked annotators to *imagine* what must, can, or cannot also be true about the described situation. We use the image to skip the imagination part, having ground truth about whether the situation that makes the hypothesis true is the same or not. But, as we will see, this comes at the cost of what perhaps is noisier data. (We have put some of this data to crowdworkers to let them judge similarity; the experiment has been published in \\cite{schlangen:iwcs19} and is documented in another notebook here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\cite{youngetal:flickr30k} pioneered the idea of making use of the image / expression relation, defining a notion of *approximate entailment* and testing it via (sets) of images and partially constructed captions."

    "Finally, one might ask why this is an important notion to model. Here the answer would be that being able to recognise entailment (or weaker forms of it) is crucial for being able to understand discourses, as they are structured by relations between their constituent expressions. While the presentation below will mostly be organised by the types of expressions that are related (where we extend the discussion to relations between expressions of types other than sentence as well), we will also point out where such relations might be found in real discourses, and what the use of being able to recognise them would be."

    "There is a long tradition of work on word meaning where it is modelled not via denotations (as in the *denotations* part of this notebook), but rather via contexts of use, as recorded in corpora (see survey in \\cite{turney-pantel:10}), and where the central notion for which it is put to work is not *truth* relative to a model, but rather the (somewhat vaguer) notion of semantic *similarity*. This tradition has recently been refreshed by the advent of more powerful methods for learning these representations from corpora \\cite{Mikolov2013:embeddings}.\n",

    "The context of use that are the basis of these approaches typically are only linguistic contexts as found in text corpora. The image corpora discussed here open up the possiblitiy to structure the context further, by the referential uses that were made of the expressions. For example, we can look at which words occur together in references to an object (*within context* use), and distinguish them from words that don't (*outside* words). (We report results for such an approach in \\cite{zaschla:contground}, showing that for visual referntial similarity, it outperforms purely textually trained representations.)\n",

    "## What Would a Model have to Learn, and What Might it Look Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having looked at various data sets that can be created, which all bring out different aspects of the general *implies* relation, we can pause briefly to ask what a model that learns this relation from that data would have to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first thing to note here is that it seems that it can't just be logical rules (or rather, the meaning of logical constants) that is to be learned here. This might be enough for pairs such as \"all girls are coding / the girl on the left is coding\", but as the expressions used here come from actual use contexts (albeit in annotations), such textbook examples are unlikely to occur. In many of the cases, at the very least additional *linguistic* knowledge is required (e.g., to relate \"a woman is reading\" and \"a person is reading\"). But beyond that, in many of the examples it seems to be knowledge that presumably goes beyond linguistic knowledge and into the common sense domain to recognise the relation (e.g., to know that in a situation described as \"The skate boarder is riding the skateboard down a slope.\", it is likely that \"there is a helmet\" is also true).\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward modern approach now would be to use a high-capacity model (most likely a neural network) to train a classifier that takes a pair of expressions and  predicts whether the relation holds or not. (And which in that sense learns and defines the relation.) This is indeed the approach typically taken to the \"Natural Language Inference\" task \\cite{snli:emnlp2015}, and with some good success.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just note here that in the settings described here, other approaches also seem possible. We said above that the semantic view on the relation is that it holds in case every model of the premise is also a model of the hypothesis. Given a way to evaluate an expression relative to a model, as sketched in Section [Expressions and Denotations](#Expressions-and-Denotations), this quantification over models could indeed be realised, as quantification over all available images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would, however, require the availability of a reasonably large set of reference models -- which perhaps means that the approach loses in cognitive plausiblity. (If that is a goal.) An approach that sits somewhere between the direct prediction and the model exemplar checking would be one where a (set of) models is *predicted* from the premise, against which the hypothesis is then evaluated. There are methods in the literature that aim to go from natural language expressions (typically, captions) to images or semi-symbolic representations such as image layouts \\cite{Hong2018}, \\cite{Zhao2018}, which could perhaps be used for this. The advantage of such a model would be that it would be inspectable and hence lending itself to also making *explanations* derivable."
